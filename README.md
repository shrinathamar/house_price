Abstrct :
This project solved the regression type of problem. In this model predict house price based on feature of home and location.

Key Features : Square ft, BHK of home, No. of Bathrooms, location of home in city, etc.

We perform the EDA first and in feature engineering we handled missing values, outliers and perform encoding on categorical feature like location.
Model train with differenty algorithm, as good accuracy score acheived in linear regression.
Model trained with Linear Regression.

We also build API for this Project and successfully test with postman application as well as by creating html webpage.
Model also succefully test after model deployment on AWS machine.

Final Model  :Linear Regression
Final Score  : 90%
